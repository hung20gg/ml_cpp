## Implementation Machine Learning Algorithm in C++

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms using C++. The goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for learning and experimenting with machine learning techniques in C++.

With lots of `.fit` library out there, it is harder to truely understand how a machine learning algorithm work, so I hope this repo will give you a brief insight on the implementation of them.


### Algorithms Implemented

- [ ] **Linear Regression** (to lazy)
- [X] **Logistic Regression**
- [X] **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- [X] K-Means Clustering
- [X] **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- [X] Decision Trees
- [ ] Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- [ ] Naive Bayes
- [X] DBSCAN
- [ ] GMM

If you want any other model, feel free to issue this repo.
